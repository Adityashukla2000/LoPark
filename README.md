its my final year major project (Smart Parking System) and project based on hardware and software.The primary objective of the Smart Parking Application is to provide drivers with real-time information on available parking spots. The application will be designed to help drivers save time and reduce traffic congestion by guiding them to the nearest available parking spot.
